Making Flappy Bird Using Javascript and HTML

1.In this we make a flappybird game,controlled by spacebar or up and down keys.
2.Page reloads as the game finishes,i.e. the bird collides with the pipe.
3.Score is displayed a s the bird pasees the pipes.
4.Audio files have also been attatched as the bird flies and as it collides..

Thankyou So Much!!
